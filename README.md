Figure-01 Internal circuit for seven segment MPX4 display



### Theory: 
	7 Segment Display has seven segments in it and each segment has one LED inside it to display the numbers by lighting up the corresponding segments. Like if you want the 7-segment to display the number "5" then you need to glow segment a,f,g,c, and d by making their corresponding pins high. There are two types of 7-segment displays: Common Cathode and Common Anode, here we are using Common Cathode seven segment display.
